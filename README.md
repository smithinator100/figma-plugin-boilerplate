## Figma Plugin Boilerplate

Minimal two-step setup.

### 1) Copy–paste this into Cursor’s Terminal
```bash
chmod +x create-plugin.sh && ./create-plugin.sh "My Figma Plugin"
```
- Replace "My Figma Plugin" with your desired name.

### 2) Use the generated Cursor rules
- Open the newly created plugin folder in Cursor (`cd my-figma-plugin`).
- Cursor will automatically use the `.cursorrules` in the project root when this folder is the workspace.

That’s it.
